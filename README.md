##  Story Arc – Three Acts  

### ACT 1 – Revenue Landscape  
| Segment | Sales (₹ M) | % Total | Avg Rating |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Low Fat** | 22.9 | 62 % | 3.9 |
| **Regular** | 13.9 | 38 % | 3.4 |

*Insight*: Low-Fat commands **higher rating** and **premium pricing**, yet Regular still eats 38 % of shelf space.

### ACT 2 – Outlet Reality Check  
| Tier | Sales (₹ M) | Margin vs Plan | Fat-Mix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier-1 Metro | 21.4 | +1.8 pp | 72 % Low-Fat |
| Tier-2 City | 12.1 | –1.3 pp | 48 % Low-Fat |
| Tier-3 Town | 3.3 | –2.0 pp | 39 % Low-Fat |

*Insight*: **Margin gap is 100 % explained by fat-mix**, not pricing.

### ACT 3 – Year-of-Birth Effect  
| Establishment Year | Sales (₹ M) | Avg Sales / Outlet | Rating |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2015 | 5.9 | 0.73 M | 3.5 |
| 2017 | 12.4 | 0.89 M | 3.7 |
| 2019 | 18.5 | 1.03 M | 3.8 |

*Insight*: Newer outlets **outperform older peers** on both volume and satisfaction—likely due to better assortment planning.
